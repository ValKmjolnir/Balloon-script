# Balloon-script

A new script language and the subset of nasal

# Why i create this language:

Before i decided to write this interpreter, i had tried almost about three months to make Nasal-script interpreter.

But making an interpreter for nasal whose grammar is tha same as ECMA6 is totally a impossible work for one developer like me.

So i decided to make a simpler language but is the subset of Nasal-script.

And finally i made it.Then this language was born.Hope you will love this simple language.

Also, i hope the interpreter's codes will give you different inspiration to make your own interpreter.

You can still see the code in Nasal-Interpreter: https://github.com/ValKmjolnir/Nasal-Interpreter
